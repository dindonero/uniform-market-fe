# WattSwap frontend (Communitas-uniform-market-fe)

Next.js Pages Router app for an on-chain energy bidding market. Buyers post bids and
sellers post asks per hourly delivery slot; the contract clears matched orders. Portugal,
Spain, Italy and Denmark each have their own `EnergyBiddingMarket` contract on Nova Cidade.
The app also bridges ETH from Arbitrum Sepolia (L2) to Nova Cidade (L3) via Arbitrum Orbit,
carries an NFT tab, and serves a `/faucet` route. Deployed at https://wattswap.vercel.app.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16 (Pages Router) + React 19
- wagmi v2 + Reown AppKit (formerly Web3Modal)
- viem 2.x. ethers v5 arrives indirectly through `@arbitrum/sdk` and is used for the bridge
  and for `AppContext`'s providers
- Tailwind 4, lucide-react, motion, react-day-picker, d3 (dashboard)

## Commands

Package manager is npm (`package-lock.json`; there is no pnpm lockfile).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev                # next dev, localhost:3000
npm run build              # next build --webpack
npm run start
npm run lint               # eslint .
```

## Chains

- **Nova Cidade (default)**: chainId `93735000855` / `0x15d30a9b17`, RPC
  `https://testnet.novaims.unl.pt/`, explorer `https://testnet.explorer.novaims.unl.pt/`.
  Defined in `src/config/chains.ts` from `constants/outputInfo.json`. Hosts every
  `EnergyBiddingMarket` contract.
- **Arbitrum Sepolia (parent)**: chainId `421614`, RPC from `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_RPC`
  (an Alchemy endpoint). Origin chain for the deposit flow.

Every parent-chain call in the browser must read `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_RPC`. Next.js only
inlines `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` into the client bundle, so a plain `process.env.FOO` in client code
is `undefined` at runtime and silently falls back. `utils/mapOrbitConfigToOrbitChain.ts`
used to read `process.env.L1RPC` and fell through to the public
`sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc`, which rate-limits per IP. Fixed 2026-08-26 and `L1RPC`
removed from `.env`. That was a latent fault, not the cause of the Aug-2026 bridge failure
described below.

### Which RPC each surface uses

| Surface | Path | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Reads on Nova Cidade (market, NFT tab `useReadContract`) | wagmi transport | `https://testnet.novaims.unl.pt/` |
| Reads on Arbitrum Sepolia | wagmi transport | `fallback([Alchemy, public arb RPC])` |
| Bridge and NFT bridge `l1Provider` | `AppContext` ethers | `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_RPC` (Alchemy), no fallback |
| Bridge and NFT bridge `l2Provider` | `AppContext` ethers | `https://testnet.novaims.unl.pt/` |
| Orbit SDK registration | `mapOrbitConfigToOrbitChain` | `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_RPC`, defaults `confirmPeriodBlocks` to 150 on failure |
| Sending a transaction | the user's wallet | MetaMask's own RPC, not the app's |

### Bridge deposit failed with `-32005 Request is being rate limited` (Aug 2026)

MetaMask never opened. The error surfaced from `SubmitDepositButton`'s catch with
`httpStatus: 429` and a stack entirely inside the extension. The deposit's reads were going
through the wallet, not the app: ethers routes `estimateGas` through `signer.provider`
(`node_modules/@ethersproject/providers/lib/json-rpc-provider.js:266`), and the button's
`getBlock("latest")` used the same provider. `signer` comes from `useEthersSigner`, which
wraps the wagmi transport in a `Web3Provider`, so both landed on MetaMask's built-in
Arbitrum Sepolia endpoint, which is shared across all MetaMask users and throttles.

Fix: both reads now go through `AppContext`'s `l1Provider` (the keyed Alchemy endpoint) via
a local `readProvider`, and the estimated `gasLimit` is passed in `overrides` so ethers has
no reason to ask the wallet. MetaMask is left with `eth_chainId` and the
`eth_sendTransaction` itself. This is mitigation, not a cure: MetaMask still broadcasts
through its own RPC and polls on it in the background, so a user whose MetaMask is badly
throttled should point that network at a keyed RPC in wallet settings.

`SubmitWithdrawalButton.tsx:47` still has the `signer.provider!.getBlock("latest")` pattern,
but a withdrawal signs on Nova Cidade, where MetaMask uses our own node rather than a shared
public endpoint. Left as-is.

Notes:
- The Alchemy key is public by design (it ships in the client bundle). Restrict it by origin
  in the Alchemy dashboard rather than trying to hide it. The same key is used by the nitro
  node and by Blockscout's `INDEXER_ARBITRUM_L1_RPC`; the indexer's `eth_getLogs` sweeps are
  the heavy consumer.
- `testnet.novaims.unl.pt` and `wattswap.novaims.unl.pt` are split-horizon: `10.10.2.57` on
  campus, `193.136.119.39` publicly. Both are the same box, so there is no second Nova Cidade
  endpoint to fall back to. `wagmi.ts` therefore uses a bare `http()` transport for Nova
  Cidade and a `fallback()` only for Arbitrum Sepolia.
- Remaining single points of failure: the Nova Cidade node itself, and `AppContext`'s
  `l1Provider` (a plain `StaticJsonRpcProvider`, no failover). Add a `FallbackProvider` there
  if Alchemy outages start affecting the NFT bridge.

## Environment variables

`.env` (see `.env.example`): `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` (Reown), `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_RPC`
(Alchemy Arbitrum Sepolia), `FAUCET_PASSWORD`, `FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY`. The two faucet vars are
server-side only, deliberately without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

## Faucet (`/faucet`)

- Page `src/pages/faucet.tsx`, API `src/pages/api/faucet.ts`.
- Each request sends two transactions from the same wallet
  (`0x7502e2fcD1416648e4F2392B8F274C7f1e5b1081`):
  0.01 ETH on Nova Cidade (`FAUCET_AMOUNT_NOVA`), which covers all market tests, and
  0.0015 ETH on Arbitrum Sepolia (`FAUCET_AMOUNT_ARB`), which covers the two bridge-dependent
  tests (TC09.01 deposit and the withdrawal claim). The Arb figure is 0.001 ETH to bridge plus
  roughly 0.0005 ETH of gas headroom across both legs at a ~0.02 gwei base fee.
- The Arb Sepolia send applies `maxFeePerGas = baseFee * 5` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas = 0`,
  the same pattern as the bridge buttons, to avoid the "max fee per gas less than block base
  fee" revert.
- Min-balance guards: `MIN_BALANCE_NOVA = 0.02`, `MIN_BALANCE_ARB = 0.003`.
- The response keeps the legacy `{hash, amount, explorer}` fields (Nova) and adds
  `{novaCidade, arbitrumSepolia}` objects, each `{chain, amount, hash, explorer}`. The success
  view renders one transaction block per chain with copy and explorer links.
- Verified end to end 2026-06-02, both transactions confirmed on-chain (Nova `0x94b768…c4a0`,
  Arb `0x9db393…f09d15`).
- The faucet wallet is also the Nova Cidade **batch poster** (`batchPoster` in
  `constants/outputInfo.json`). Draining it on Arbitrum Sepolia stops the chain posting
  batches to the parent chain. Watch its Sepolia balance.

## Conventions

- The contract works in watts, the UI displays kWh. `WATTS_PER_KWH = 1000` is defined in
  `src/config/constants.ts`; the conversion helpers live in `src/utils/units.ts`.
- `RegionDropdownList` swaps `energyMarketAddress` on `AppContext`. It defaults to the user's
  geo-detected country via `utils/fetchUserCountry.ts`, falling back to the first available
  region.
- The wagmi default chain is Nova Cidade, so the wallet auto-switches there after
  `Connect Wallet`. `/bridge` switches back to Arbitrum Sepolia for the deposit step.
- `TransactionStatus` phases: `idle | pending | confirming | bridging | success | error`
  (`src/components/ui/TransactionModal.tsx`).
- Both bridge buttons pass explicit gas overrides (`maxFeePerGas = baseFee * 5`,
  `maxPriorityFeePerGas = 0`, the Arbitrum sequencer ignores tips). Do not remove them, see
  the 2026-05-20 bug below.

## Test cases

TC09.01 connect wallet and bridge Arbitrum to Nova Cidade; TC09.02 place a bid;
TC09.04 check bid result (Buyer Orders); TC09.06 claim refund (buyer); TC09.08 cancel bid
order; TC09.10 dashboard / hourly energy data.

## Known bugs found 2026-05-20

Found with Playwright + dappwright (MetaMask 13.17.0) against https://wattswap.vercel.app/.

1. **Bridge deposit reverted with "max fee per gas less than block base fee" (HIGH, fixed).**
   `SubmitDepositButton` called `EthBridger.deposit({ amount, parentSigner })` with no gas
   overrides. The ethers v5 default (`maxFeePerGas = baseFee * 2 + maxPriorityFeePerGas`)
   routinely lands below the next block's base fee on Arbitrum Sepolia, whose base fee moves
   within seconds (observed `maxFeePerGas=20002000` against `baseFee=20006000`). The
   transaction was rejected with `code -32603`.

   Fixed in `SubmitDepositButton.tsx` and `SubmitWithdrawalButton.tsx` by reading the latest
   block's `baseFeePerGas`, computing `maxFeePerGas = baseFee * 5` and
   `maxPriorityFeePerGas = 0`, and passing them via `overrides`. Verified on-chain 2026-05-20:
   L1 transaction `0xa1dbd4…5435` on Arb Sepolia, L1 to L2 message landed on Nova Cidade
   (`complete: true`), 0.001 ETH bridged. Not an RPC staleness issue, three independent RPCs
   returned the same base fee.

   The 2026-05 fix read the base fee off the *signer's* provider. In Aug 2026 the deposit path
   was changed again to read off `AppContext`'s `l1Provider` instead, for the rate-limiting
   reason above. The withdrawal path still reads off the signer.

2. **Hydration mismatch on every page load, React error #418 (MEDIUM, fixed).**
   `src/components/common/DateTimePicker.tsx` initialised state with `getNextHour(1)`, which
   calls `new Date()`, so SSR and CSR markup differed and React aborted hydration. Fixed with a
   `mounted` flag: before mount the component returns a fixed-height placeholder `<div>`
   (`minHeight: 480`) and the real picker swaps in on the first client `useEffect` tick. The
   state defaults stay numeric.

3. **Two `<svg>` width/height "Unexpected end of attribute" console warnings (LOW, open).**
   An SVG renders with empty `width=""` / `height=""` during initial load. No local component
   passes an empty string; every `<Image>` and `<svg>` callsite supplies a literal number or a
   defaulted prop. Likely a third party (react-day-picker's nav icon, or Reown AppKit's
   `<w3m-modal>` shadow DOM) before its own data resolves. Cosmetic.

## Verified end to end

Wallet connect through Reown AppKit to MetaMask; auto network switch to Nova Cidade after
connect; manual switch back to Arbitrum Sepolia on `/bridge` (`wallet_addEthereumChain` plus
`wallet_switchEthereumChain`); bridge deposit Arb Sepolia to Nova Cidade with the gas
overrides applied, retryable ticket auto-redeemed and child balance credited; `Place Bid` on
the Buy tab against Portugal, Spain and Denmark; `Cancel Bid` round trip on the Orders tab for
Spain and Denmark. Orders, Trades, Claim, NFTs and Dashboard all render, and the "Wrong
Network" guard forces a switch when the wallet sits on Arbitrum Sepolia.

## Playwright + MetaMask test harness

A persistent MetaMask profile lives at `~/.cache/wattswap-test/`. Reuse it rather than
re-onboarding MetaMask every run: first connect drops from roughly 60 to 90 seconds
(dappwright bootstrap) to about 11 seconds, because Chromium launches with the cached profile
and wagmi auto-reconnects from saved cookies.

```js
import { openMM, driveMM, shadowClick } from '/home/USER/.cache/wattswap-test/mm-launcher.mjs';

const { context, mmExtensionId, close } = await openMM();
const page = await context.newPage();
await page.goto('https://wattswap.vercel.app');     // already connected
await driveMM(context, 'tx-confirm');               // approves any open MM popup
await close();
```

Smoke test: `node ~/.cache/wattswap-test/smoke-launcher.mjs`. Rebuild the cache after a
MetaMask upgrade with `node ~/.cache/wattswap-test/bootstrap-once.mjs`. The cache imports
`FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY` from this repo's `.env`.

Why the launcher exists, given `@tenkeylabs/dappwright` against MM 13.17:

- `dappwright.bootstrap(...)` only triggers the MetaMask download when
  `process.env.TEST_PARALLEL_INDEX === '0'`. Always export `TEST_PARALLEL_INDEX=0` outside
  `@playwright/test`'s parallel runner, otherwise it sits forever printing "Waiting for primary
  worker to download metamask…".
- Force `DISPLAY=:1` (and `XAUTHORITY=/run/user/<UID>/gdm/Xauthority`) so Playwright launches
  the full `chromium-1223/chrome-linux64/chrome` rather than the headless-shell binary, which
  cannot load extensions.
- Drive the MetaMask popup yourself: enumerate `context.pages()` for a
  `chrome-extension://…/notification.html` page and click `getByTestId('confirm-btn')`,
  `getByTestId('confirm-footer-button')` or
  `getByRole('button', { name: /^(connect|confirm|next|approve)$/i })`.
- `wallet.addNetwork` is flaky in MM 13.17. Skip it and let the dApp drive network registration
  through `wallet_addEthereumChain` prompts approved by the same popup driver.

## Test wallet

`FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` is the key for `0x7502e2fcD1416648e4F2392B8F274C7f1e5b1081`,
the same wallet the live `/faucet` route drips from and the Nova Cidade batch poster.
Automated tests deplete it, and an empty Sepolia balance stops batch posting. Check its
balance before and after a test run.
